Dear Jeff, 

Back for another wonderful year.&nbsp; So many changes all over the campus.&nbsp; Life itself is an ever-changing adventure.&nbsp; Please donâ€™t misunderstand me, I welcome change with the youthful exuberance of any spring chicken, but I am so glad to see that the food court is exactly where it used to be.&nbsp; It sure made getting my first meal easy, because I already knew where the delicious food was, especially those heavenly waffle fries were.)
