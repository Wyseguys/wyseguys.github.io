Dear Jeff,

What ever happened to the potato bar? It has been some time since the Elton John face, and I have had many vivid (sometimes explicit) dreams since then. I am itching to create art again. I donâ€™t care what the cost will be, I feel that this new creative outlet will help me pay off all these students loans. Sadly, I cannot complete this dream of mine without the help of the food court
