Dear Jeff,

Last time you served the potato bar, a funny thing happened. The strange combination of potato, sour cream, cheese, and olives made a near perfect replica of Elton John's face. (Colors didn't match, but what do you expect, it was a potato) I was astounded. I had no idea that potato was a viable art medium. Does this mean that you will raise the price on potato bar?
