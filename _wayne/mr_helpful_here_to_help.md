Dear Jeff,

I read in the most recent edition of the Siskiyou, (a fine publication) that the school is having problems with stray dogs on campus. I also assume that the price of food is not going down. Now I am all in favor of multiculturalism, therefore I propose we expand our horizons a bit and solve the stray dog problem, all at the same time. I think you can see where I am heading with this. Dog bar! Hot DOG, DOGGIE doodles, roast dachshunds, the list can go on and on. That little outside of Taylor around noon looks really good to me. Contact me if you need some recipes.
