Dear Jeff,

I have a wonderful idea for improving the service in the cafeteria food court eating area. Two words: conveyor belts. A conveyor belt to bring the food, and another to bus the trays. I believe that it would be cost effective to do this, think of the savings! If you want, I could write this up for the technology resource fund. Thanks for your consideration.
