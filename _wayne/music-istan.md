Dear Jeff,

I know that the students (and I ) enjoy hearing music while we eat.&nbsp; Rather than listen to the radio station rotation, (I love it I really do) I wish to offer the students a different slice of world culture.&nbsp; Former Soviet Republic Khazikstanian&nbsp; World Championship yodeling team.&nbsp; I have hours and hours on tape, including the 71â€™&nbsp; Koldazikstan concert featuring Ivan Yt.&nbsp; I know everyone will love it as much they love those wonderful waffle fries.
