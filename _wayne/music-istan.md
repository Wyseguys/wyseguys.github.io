Dear Jeff,

I know that the students (and I ) enjoy hearing music while we eat. Rather than listen to the radio station rotation, (I love it I really do) I wish to offer the students a different slice of world culture. Former Soviet Republic Khazikstanian World Championship yodeling team. I have hours and hours on tape, including the 71â€™ Koldazikstan concert featuring Ivan Yt. I know everyone will love it as much they love those wonderful waffle fries.
