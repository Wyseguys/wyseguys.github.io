Thanks for the camera you guys!  I spent a rainy afternoon dumping a bunch of videos.

I decided that nobody cares if I edit them up and put a soundtrack on the noise.  I might still make some of those videos, but four years indicates that I probably won't. Here is the link to the video category <a href="/blag/category/personal/videos/">http://www.wyseguys.com/blag/category/personal/videos/</a> so you can go see everything I have done.

Don't forget to go back in time and look at the old posts.  (It is a link on the bottom of the page) In fact, here is a link to every video I shot in 2008.  <a href="http://sdrv.ms/KAsAR3">http://sdrv.ms/KAsAR3</a>  I don't promise it is all worth watching.
