**An email sign off used by people who think being an asshole is fun or funny**


Emails should be short, but people who use this term will make their signature block four or five times longer than their email.  

The content of their email is equally worthless as this dimwitted signoff

They also probably used comic sans, and should be blocked if at all possible.
