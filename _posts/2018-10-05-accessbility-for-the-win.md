So the blog and all the shitty roommate content is moving over to Jekyll.  Mostly this is a cost savings exercise.  I just don't update the site enough to justify paying for hosting when free stuff is sitting out there.

So the GitHub.io pages is a pretty good.  In addition to being easy to setup on my laptop, it is easy to publish with things I consider, or am learning, is the best way to run a website.

 - Good source control via git
 - Clean HTML via Markup, or taking the time to write it well
 - HTTPS - I may be the devil, but you know who you're talking to
 
 But I am also taking the time to really focus in on accessibility.  Sure, it is good for my job to practice on a simpel site like this one.  Lots of lessons to be learned here that will make the daily work job easilier to grasp and understand.  But also (and I really like this) accessibility is a civil right.  Just the same as a ramp near the stairs or a button to open a door, so to should the stupid Shitty Roommate be available to everybody, equally.
