It is a pretty nice house. Well built. Sturdy. The carpet is a deep purple, which isn't for me, but it feels nice. I would assume if you like dark colors or classic rock you are looking at a winner here.
 
There is a pool in the backyard. Yes, an above ground jobbie, BUT IT HAS A DEEP END. 6ft. I like it. In fact, I don't think the house will be for sale this summer because I'd like to keep that pool as global warming pushes the temperature over 1,000,000 degrees.
 
And it is close to the Black Bird. There is some pretty junky stuff, but MAN, it is the Blackbird. it is huge and rad.
