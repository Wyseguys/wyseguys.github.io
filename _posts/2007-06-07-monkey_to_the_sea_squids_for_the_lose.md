**Step 1 of the plan:**  

<u>The monkeys have spears. </u>Do I need to spell this one out for you?&nbsp; [The MONKEYS have SPEARS.](http://www.newscientist.com/article.ns?id=dn11234) This is not a drill.&nbsp; Who amongst us has not heard or worse seen a monkey hurl its doody at a person or a crowd.&nbsp; Monkeys, chimps, gorillas.... they do not like us.&nbsp; It might be jealousy of our television, it might be anger at it.&nbsp; To me, it doesn't really matter.
<br>**Step 2 of the plan:**  

<u>Sink holes.</u>&nbsp; Big ones.&nbsp; This is really just a secondary step.&nbsp; It makes the [retreat harder](http://www.cbsnews.com/stories/2007/02/23/world/main2508879.shtml), basically setting us up as sitting ducks for the spear monkey army.&nbsp; Having to dodge this pit of death will only make the monkey's happy.&nbsp;&nbsp; I would even go so far as to suggest we drop the term "sitting duck" and make it "sitting human", cause this is how it will break down.&nbsp; Plus, if mother Earth decides that there are to many monkey casualties (cause you know some fool will fight back) then the earth will just start swallowing our tanks.&nbsp; It is more or less flawless.
<br>**Step 3 of the plan:**  

<u>Three parter.</u>&nbsp; The end result is annihilation via the sea.&nbsp; Seeing as how swimming isn't really a sport or an exercise, but a struggle for life, it is clear humans don't belong in the ocean.&nbsp; Not for long periods of time.&nbsp; We turn prune-y.&nbsp; We flail and splash, and all but the best of us go very very slow.&nbsp; Ideal for being eaten, not so hot if survival is your bag.&nbsp; Warm water or cold water, we are done for.

Lets not even get started on the [virgin birth hammerhead shark.](http://news.nationalgeographic.com/news/2007/05/070524-shark-virgin.html)&nbsp; If it was immaculate conception, then I would have to say Sting Rays: 2 Evil:0.&nbsp;&nbsp; 
**The only salvation:**  

BEFRIEND THE [STINGRAY](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stingray).&nbsp; They are basically cool looking.&nbsp; They take no guff, they kill what needs killing and if you are chill, they will let you ride on them.&nbsp; They aren't two face like dolphins.&nbsp; The sting ray are our only hope.&nbsp; We need to start breeding programs, and have the military complex investigate fitting sting rays with lasers and missile launchers.&nbsp; I know you are probably think attack bears with missiles, but by the time we have the technology it might be too late.
