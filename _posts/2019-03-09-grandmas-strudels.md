Going through some old papers and I have located the long lost (or not much looked for) studel recipe my grandma made when I was a kid. 

<!--more-->

 It isn't a studel like I've read about online, it is really flour water and salt, but it brings back the old memories. Grandma would have us over for dinner, there'd be a pot roast and a bowl of strudels.  She would make it in a weird roaster thing that was embedded in the countertop, an appliance I had never seen before and have not seen since.  My hope is that a croc pot can do the job.  When gradma did it, it was really quite the performance that spreadout all over the kitchen counters and table.

Sometimes we'd kids would spend the night.  Grandma would ask what we wanted to eat, and if we said strudels, she'd tell us they took too long.  She made 'em half the time anyway.  Part of the allure was their rarity.  I haven't made these yet.  Hard to tell if I should.

Anyway, here it is, commited to my electronic conscience.

## Grandma Strudels
 - 2 cups Flour 
 - 3/4 Tsp Salt 
 - 1 Tsp Baking Powder 
 - Water - enough to make a stiff doughc
 - Potatoes 

Mix ingredients and let stand 15 minutes to ripen. Pare and slice some potatoes. Put in large roaster, add lard or other shortening, salt and water to half cover potatoes. Bring to boil. Roll dough as thin as you can and pull out as thin as possible. Spread with some butter and lard. Roll into logs and cut in 2 inch pieces. Add to potatoes and cook. 

Do not open roaster or they will fall. 

When you hear them fry for a few minutes they"ll be ready to eat.
