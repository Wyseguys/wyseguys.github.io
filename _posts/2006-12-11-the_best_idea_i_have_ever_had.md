The best sort of thing to do with a journal, especially a public facing one, is to lambaste oneself and archive that information on a distant spot with not control over the information once it is posted. The most preferable type of information is anger. A generous sprinkling of expletives and you will soon amass yourself a fine catalog of embarrassing material to prevent future employment and perhaps even relationships.
 
To this end I will only give out pleasantries and complements to all. To anyone who reads this. You look wonderful, and I really like that sweater on you! To anybody who is snooping around, I bet you bake the meanest and most delicious brownies this side of the Mississip' and if I could have a plate again I would consider myself a lucky man.
 
A special note to all my current and future employers, relationships, friends, religious mentors, karate instructors or doctors: I am impressed with your down to earth attitudes and intellectual common sense. I am better for knowing you all.
 
Finally, if you are reading up on me because you know me or think you might know me from the past, let me just say that I am pleased as punch that you could take the time to stop by. I have really missed seeing you, and I am so happy to get to see you again.
