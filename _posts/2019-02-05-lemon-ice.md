This is a recipe for lemon ice my grandma made when I was a kid. She wrote it down one day when I first left home after college and I really liked it.

This was something I couldn't find online.  There are lots of recipes online for something called "lemon ice" but they often aren't exactly this.  I sort of think this is some family thing, depression era food.  Tastes good, easy to make, pretty cheap.

I'd often get this with my family when we'd have dinner over at Grandma and Grandpa's house.  There is a kind of a weird "lemon and milk" texture on my mouth, but all the sugar more than made up for it.

Like most things in my life, I don't have any confusion that this is fine dining or hoi paloi, but I honestly prefer it that way.

Mix Water and Sugar and boil for 5 minutes. Add in Lemon Juice and put into freezer until almost firm. 

Whip and then freeze until almost firm again. Repeat if desired. Add the Cool Whip and mix in. 

Serve in ice cold sherbet dishes with the meal.
