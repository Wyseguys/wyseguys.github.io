*Got a new game to play. You need some plywood and some bags of corn.*

I have been playing this game in backyards all over Southern Oregon, and ever since I found it on a camping trip it is faithfully consumed my entire life.

I have now been a part of building two complete sets, at a cost of about $40 each. This habit is cheaper than drugs, and the high last longer. If only I could play JUST ONE MORE ROUND I could get good enough to beat the shooter in our group 

If you want to play, check out the web or keep checking here for updates.
