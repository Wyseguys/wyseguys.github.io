I had a bad roommate myself. He smoked in the house. He wasn't so very clean. But at the very least I liked the guy and we were buds. I think it is easy to be a dude's buddy if he doesn't fill the toilet full of fecal lasagna.

I have had some really cool guys be my roommates in the past; a spectrum full of men different then me and willing to lend their personalities to the overall picture of me. For that I thank you all. I can cook potatoes, light a cigarette, run a business, respect cologne usage, despise perverts and criminals with a vicious ire and even dance a little.

Peace to y'all
