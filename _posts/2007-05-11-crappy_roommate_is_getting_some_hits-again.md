I had a bad roommate myself.&nbsp; He smoked in the house.&nbsp; He wasn't so very clean.&nbsp; But at the very least I liked the guy and we were buds.&nbsp; I think it is easy to be a dude's buddy if he doesn't fill the toilet full of fecal lasagna.

I have had some really cool guys be my roommates in the past; a spectrum full of men different then me and willing to lend their personalities to the overall picture of me.&nbsp; For that I thank you all.&nbsp; I can cook potatoes, light a cigarette, run a business, respect cologne usage, despise perverts and criminals with a vicious ire and even dance a little.<br><br>Peace to y'all
