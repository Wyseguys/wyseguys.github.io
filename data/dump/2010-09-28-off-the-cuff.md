<p>Ashley does some really funny things.  We aren’t the best at taking pictures of it all lately.  I would get the camera more often, but we are usually to busy talking to the girl to remember.</p>  <p><embed type="application/x-shockwave-flash" src="http://picasaweb.google.com/s/c/bin/slideshow.swf" width="400" height="267" flashvars="host=picasaweb.google.com&amp;hl=en_US&amp;feat=flashalbum&amp;RGB=0x000000&amp;feed=http%3A%2F%2Fpicasaweb.google.com%2Fdata%2Ffeed%2Fapi%2Fuser%2Fwyseguys%2Falbumid%2F5521129549736518209%3Falt%3Drss%26kind%3Dphoto%26authkey%3DGv1sRgCKiBvYKf4ayEXQ%26hl%3Den_US" pluginspage="http://www.macromedia.com/go/getflashplayer" /></p>  <p>In today’s episode, we find Ashley destroying the living room, walking around the living room in high heels, and being tuned into the TV in various locals.</p>
