<p>The first week of September we traveled to Boise, ID to visit with Ashley’s great grandparents and go with Grandma Marsha to Roaring Springs Water Park.</p>  <p>Ashley and the team traveled from their house to the airport and back on the public transit, and in true style Ashley was a sweet heart the whole time.  In fact, she was so good on the plane ride to Boise, a couple of people took the time to tell us how sweet and quiet she was, which made for two very proud parents.</p>  <p>Some of these photos were taken with our digital camera, and some where taken with disposable waterproof cameras.  There really aren’t enough photos (unless you are Chris with his wonder-gut and you wish there were even fewer) because we didn’t think it wise to take the video camera or the regular digital into a water park.</p>  <p><embed type="application/x-shockwave-flash" src="http://picasaweb.google.com/s/c/bin/slideshow.swf" width="400" height="267" flashvars="host=picasaweb.google.com&amp;hl=en_US&amp;feat=flashalbum&amp;RGB=0x000000&amp;feed=http%3A%2F%2Fpicasaweb.google.com%2Fdata%2Ffeed%2Fapi%2Fuser%2Fwyseguys%2Falbumid%2F5383633821596396833%3Falt%3Drss%26kind%3Dphoto%26authkey%3DGv1sRgCLGTi8K_8vuJ7QE%26hl%3Den_US" pluginspage="http://www.macromedia.com/go/getflashplayer" /></p>
