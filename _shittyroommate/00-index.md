**NOTE**  This story is not mine.  The original content belongs to a fella by the name of *Martin Random*.  This story is saved from a [thread on www.somethingawful.com](http://forums.somethingawful.com/showthread.php?threadid=1353420) and all credit for it should belong to the respective creators.  I did my best to credit all artists and writers, but since I did this in my spare time at work, I certainly could have missed something.  I will happily adjust the page to reflect credit where credit is due.  Please enjoy.

The following nine pages of horror is not safe for work.  Or your mind.  I purposely left in the rough language to let people know right off the bat what is going to happen.  Don’t let the little ones read this either.  I can’t be held responsible for your poor parenting.
