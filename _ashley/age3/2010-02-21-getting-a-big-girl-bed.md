<p>Ashley graduated from a crib into a new bed.  Mommy picked it out and made a very nice bedroom for our baby to sleep and play in.  The bed will expand all the way out the length of a twin, so Miss Ashley has some room to grow in it.</p>  <p><embed type="application/x-shockwave-flash" src="http://picasaweb.google.com/s/c/bin/slideshow.swf" width="400" height="267" flashvars="host=picasaweb.google.com&amp;hl=en_US&amp;feat=flashalbum&amp;RGB=0x000000&amp;feed=http%3A%2F%2Fpicasaweb.google.com%2Fdata%2Ffeed%2Fapi%2Fuser%2Fwyseguys%2Falbumid%2F5458009585339825761%3Falt%3Drss%26kind%3Dphoto%26authkey%3DGv1sRgCO_ppa29uKGgUg%26hl%3Den_US" pluginspage="http://www.macromedia.com/go/getflashplayer" /></p>  <p>It was pretty much the greatest thing to the the little princess, and she took to swimming in the bed like a crow takes to corn.  Admittedly there was a “falling out” incident the first night, but since then it has been almost perfect.</p>
