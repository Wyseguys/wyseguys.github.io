<p>The day started normally enough, Ashley woke up and had herself a peanut butter sandwich for breakfast</p>  <p><embed type="application/x-shockwave-flash" src="http://picasaweb.google.com/s/c/bin/slideshow.swf" width="288" height="192" flashvars="host=picasaweb.google.com&amp;hl=en_US&amp;feat=flashalbum&amp;RGB=0x000000&amp;feed=http%3A%2F%2Fpicasaweb.google.com%2Fdata%2Ffeed%2Fapi%2Fuser%2Fwyseguys%2Falbumid%2F5555030246260963633%3Falt%3Drss%26kind%3Dphoto%26authkey%3DGv1sRgCNvQ6Y_7wqipVw%26hl%3Den_US" pluginspage="http://www.macromedia.com/go/getflashplayer" /> </p>  <p>And while all of that was pretty cute, we had to do some real work this day.
