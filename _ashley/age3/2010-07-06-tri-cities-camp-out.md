Why Fish Lake campground, run by the Army Corp of Engineers, is a good place to go camp and spend the night.
<ol>
	<li>On the snake river, so if you like to fish…</li>
	<li>Near Kennewick, WA so if you live there and don’t want to travel…</li>
	<li>You might have a free pass or something.</li>
</ol>

Reasons Fish Lake is horrid.  I mean so bad I would rather stay at Crystal Lake and run my chances with Jason than stay here again.  So bad that it would be better to have my toes cut off by a skilsaw than spend another night.
<ol>
	<li>There is a water spout, but they put a lock on it</li>
	<li>You could leave through the gate, but they locked that too</li>
	<li>They have a smallish lawn they call multifamily tent sites.  But what they mean is <em>everybody with a tent, c’mon</em></li>
	<li>There were plenty of drunk high school kids
<ol>
	<li>With even louder parents</li>
	<li>Playing football, and I am not making this up, throwing the ball into our tent</li>
	<li>They were only 20 feet away.  (I have no problem with teenagers, but they are all still as stupid as I was)</li>
</ol>
</li>
	<li>There was a JR High School kid trying to make the high school kids look like boy scouts.  He was listening to his iPod until 2am,<em> with his attached boom box!!</em></li>
	<li>Nobody sleeps, they were all up and talking like it was 5 in the afternoon,  but at 2am!!!</li>
	<li>THERE IS A VERY ACTIVE TRAIN TRACK 200 YARDS AWAY.  There was a train running every couple of hours all night long.</li>
</ol>
