Ashley was a ladybug for Halloween 2009.  On Friday the 30th Ashley and her parents went to a party at her daycare.  There was a parade of costumes, pestering of the people in the offices above the daycare, and some cookies and cakes.

Then for Halloween the family went to a party at the gym for a fun party there, and then off to Salem to show off her costume to Ashley’s grandparents.  We finished up the night at the home of the Jennings and went for some real trick of treating.

Ashley walked most of the way, and even did some of her own door knocking to gather candy.  Daddy was so proud he barely stole any of her loot.
