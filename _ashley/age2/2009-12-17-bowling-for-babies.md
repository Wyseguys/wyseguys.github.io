<p>Ashley is a better bowler than either of us.  She was charming at the lanes and basically a good sport.  Part of being a good bowler in Ashley’s world is charming the glitter off of the nice ladies in the lane next to us and the nice server lady.  Everybody was impressed.</p>  <p><embed type="application/x-shockwave-flash" src="http://picasaweb.google.com/s/c/bin/slideshow.swf" width="400" height="267" flashvars="host=picasaweb.google.com&amp;captions=1&amp;hl=en_US&amp;feat=flashalbum&amp;RGB=0x000000&amp;feed=http%3A%2F%2Fpicasaweb.google.com%2Fdata%2Ffeed%2Fapi%2Fuser%2Fwyseguys%2Falbumid%2F5415304657779366833%3Falt%3Drss%26kind%3Dphoto%26authkey%3DGv1sRgCPrNsIraw-bMjQE%26hl%3Den_US" pluginspage="http://www.macromedia.com/go/getflashplayer" /></p>  <p>Ashley scored a legitimate 30 (without weak bumper usage) in her 4 frames.</p>
