I think that it wasn’t really the swine flu because by all accounts the whole family should have been sicker than dogs for over a week.  That just didn’t happen.  Mom and dad escaped with little to no effects.  Sure we had headaches, coughs, runny noses and general malaise, but since nobody got all the symptoms at once or any kind of temperature I am willing to chalk it up to poor health in general related to our sedentary lifestyles and Delta Burke poor eating habits.

Ashley felt much better the next couple of days as well.  She perked up very quickly and by Sunday was running around demanding things and generally bossing us around that we knew she felt good.  Ashley and daddy stayed home on Monday to be double triple sure that all the sickness was gone, but we both felt better to get back into the routine by Tuesday.
