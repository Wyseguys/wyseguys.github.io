<p>Grandpa Ducky’s birthday was in Newport, OR at the Embarcadero resort.  We spent some time crabbing in the bay, boiling crabs and everybody but dad spent a lot of time gutting and pulling crab apart so mom could make some delicious crab cakes, crab salad, crab dip and a bunch of other stuff.</p>  <p>It was a very fun weekend that everybody got to relax.  Ashley had a great time, slept well and learned that she likes to go for boat rides.  The weather was fantastic for the weekend, and on a shopping trip with Grandma, Ashley got herself a new purse.  She keeps candy in it.</p>  <p><embed type="application/x-shockwave-flash" src="http://picasaweb.google.com/s/c/bin/slideshow.swf" width="400" height="267" flashvars="host=picasaweb.google.com&amp;hl=en_US&amp;feat=flashalbum&amp;RGB=0x000000&amp;feed=http%3A%2F%2Fpicasaweb.google.com%2Fdata%2Ffeed%2Fapi%2Fuser%2Fwyseguys%2Falbumid%2F5399364380384003601%3Falt%3Drss%26kind%3Dphoto%26authkey%3DGv1sRgCPzcwoieq5H0Kg%26hl%3Den_US" pluginspage="http://www.macromedia.com/go/getflashplayer" /></p>
