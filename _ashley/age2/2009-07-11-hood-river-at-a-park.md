<p> Ashley and the team met Grandma Marsha in Hood River to do a child exchange and play on the big toy. The big toy was great; old splintery wood, lots of levels and real tires. A super dangerous super fun playground.</p>
<p>Hood River is a pretty nice place from what we saw, but very steep and windy.Â  It was suspected they don't worry much about snow.<br />
