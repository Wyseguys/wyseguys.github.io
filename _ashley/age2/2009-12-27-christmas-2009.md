Ashley and the gang traveled to Athena this year for Christmas.  We left Thursday the 24th packed to the gills with presents and a happy baby.  We arrived to a house full of people in Athena and had a rocking couple of dinners, breakfasts and more snacks than a pelican could fit in it’s beak.  Ashley learned some new life skills with cooking in the kitchen with Grandma and reloading shells with Grandpa.  The uncles showed Ashley how to ride a skateboard and Aunt Tylee taught Ashley the fine art of light saber fighting.

We caught a burger and even a rare Ellis sighting on the way out of town.  It was a pretty reasonable trip home and Ashley was basically good the whole time, but did not nap.  Even though mom went on a bit of a tear putting away clothes and boxing up old toys, it was a pretty good Christmas for everybody.
