Mom and Ashley weren’t able to fully clean up the holiday mess after we got back from Athena.  So we took our last Sunday in the long weekend and put all the decorations and tree away.  We put away all of the new toys, cleaned the cupboards, organized the pantry, picked up everybody’s rooms and did several loads a laundry.  Go Mom Go.  Go! Go! Go!

For his part, Dad took Ashley on a red wagon ride around to the park and rode swings.  Christmas was great, but I think we are all glad to be home.

Glad to return to normalcy.
