The first week of September we traveled to Boise, ID to visit with Ashley’s great grandparents and go with Grandma Marsha to Roaring Springs Water Park.<

Ashley and the team traveled from their house to the airport and back on the public transit, and in true style Ashley was a sweet heart the whole time.  In fact, she was so good on the plane ride to Boise, a couple of people took the time to tell us how sweet and quiet she was, which made for two very proud parents.

Some of these photos were taken with our digital camera, and some where taken with disposable waterproof cameras.  There really aren’t enough photos (unless you are Chris with his wonder-gut and you wish there were even fewer) because we didn’t think it wise to take the video camera or the regular digital into a water park.
