Ashley's #1 birthday party was held at our local Portland Parks and Rec center.  It was pretty great.  While I am normally able to find fault in all things, I was very pleased with how the party went.  We had more people than we had space at the center, and Mary and I are so thankful to everybody that took the time to show up and sing for Ashley.    

  

Ashley is clearly loved (and perhaps a bit spoiled) and we are glad we captured pictures and video of the event so she can look back at all her friends and family.  It was very touching and I am personally blown away with the attention she is getting.
