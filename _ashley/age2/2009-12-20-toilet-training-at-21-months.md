My kid is staring to want to sit on the toilet after going potty at 21 months.  Her timing is off but the will is there; once we get the timing right there will be nothing but songs from our bathroom.  (Our potty training toilet sings when you use it)

 - She might not have a lot of hair.
 - She might not have a lot of teeth.
 - She might not string sentences together.
 - But she craps where she is supposed to.<
 
 Hell yea.
