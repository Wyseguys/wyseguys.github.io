The pictures from the roaring springs trip were taken with waterproof digital cameras.  Some of the photos were too blurry, some had my thumb taking up too much of the screen.  There are a few good shots of Ashley and the boys.  Sometimes you have to squint to see someone you know, but they are in there.

(Dear random people who are photographed here.  Sorry.)
