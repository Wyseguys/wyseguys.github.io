<p>Memorial day 2009, Mary's coworker and friends Paula and Lou generously offered us the use of their home in Lincoln City.  Right on the beach and close to some fun Chris, Mary, Ashley, Marsha, Tylee, Kutter and Kage all went for the weekend.</p>
<p>The family went to the beach to fly kits, build castles and some general horsing around.  We all took a trip to Newport, OR to visit the Oregon Coast Museum and the Wax Works.  Lunch at Mo's in Otter Rock (home of the Devil's Punch Bowl) rounded out our trip as we drove home.</p>
