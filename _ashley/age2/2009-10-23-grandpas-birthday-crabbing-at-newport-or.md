Grandpa Ducky’s birthday was in Newport, OR at the Embarcadero resort.  We spent some time crabbing in the bay, boiling crabs and everybody but dad spent a lot of time gutting and pulling crab apart so mom could make some delicious crab cakes, crab salad, crab dip and a bunch of other stuff.

It was a very fun weekend that everybody got to relax.  Ashley had a great time, slept well and learned that she likes to go for boat rides.  The weather was fantastic for the weekend, and on a shopping trip with Grandma, Ashley got herself a new purse.  She keeps candy in it.
