Ashley's friend from school came over and we had the first sleep over
<ul>
	<li><span style="line-height: 13px;">They read a book while Mom watched tv.  Overheard:  "Sorry.  I farted on your mom"  (Mary confirmed it was true)</span></li>
	<li>They stayed up playing till at least 10PM</li>
	<li>They stayed up watching movies until at least 1AM (Mary had to force them to go to sleep)</li>
	<li>They got up before 7AM and Chris made pancakes</li>
	<li>They both went to gymnastics at 9AM</li>
	<li>They came home, had a snack, hot chocolate and got ready to go to the park</li>
	<li>They went to the park at 11 until 12:30PM</li>
	<li>We dropped the friend off at 1:00PM</li>
	<li>Ashley went to sleep so hard that she couldn't be shaken awake</li>
</ul>
