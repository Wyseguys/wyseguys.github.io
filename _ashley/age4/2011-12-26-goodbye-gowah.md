What kind of savage animals live in this world?

I know I am overreacting, I know it was probably dark and the first car tire that hit the bear didn't know it.  The second and subsequent cars probably didn't even notice the pink patch of fur they drove over.  Clearly, however, that poor bear was run over for the most of the weekend as the trail of fur is almost 15 feet long.

As best as we can tell, Gowah got left on the top of the car as we loaded up, and I didn't check to see if anything was on there as we drove off.  She fell off in the driveway, well away from the street.

So far, Ashley hasn't taken any great pain or notice of her missing friend.  We spent about 30 minutes looking for her while we put Ashley to bed.  After looking everywhere, I got a sinking feeling and went out to the drive way to check that spot I noticed on the way in.  After confirming it was pink fur, we did a fast search on the Internet for a replacement.  I guess that bear is out of production, so we ordered a couple of replacements off of eBay.  I hope they get here soon.

I don't know what to tell Ashley, but I know I have to tell her the truth, or a version close so it.  Probably something along the lines of "Gowah fell off the car and got hurt.  So we have to wait for her to come back to the house in the mail.  She is going to look a little different, but it will still be your bear."

I guess that is all true enough.  I feel like poop for that little girl.
