Twas Christmas in Athena<br />
And all through the hills<br />
Not a creature was stirring<br />
Except at the Walmart where I bought some pills

Dinner was Chinese<br />
And served with big spoons<br />
We ate all the fried rice<br />
And went home kinda soon

Our family was sick<br />
Sniffles in our head<br />
Our bossy little daughter<br />
Stayed up all night in her bed

The next morning was Christmas<br />
Over at the house<br />
We saw all the family<br />
For dinner we had grouse (aka - roast beef)

We exchanged all our presents<br />
Spoiled the kids and the dogs<br />
Ashley got toys<br />
And the uncles got iPods

So we went home<br />
And found a dead bear<br />
Revived her via Dr Ebay<br />
And regrew her hair

And sorted out presents<br />
And hauled it all upstairs<br />
We will do it again next winter<br />
And do it will great care.
