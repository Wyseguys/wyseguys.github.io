Twas Christmas in Athena
And all through the hills
Not a creature was stirring
Except at the Walmart where I bought some pills

Dinner was Chinese
And served with big spoons
We ate all the fried rice
And went home kinda soon

Our family was sick
Sniffles in our head
Our bossy little daughter
Stayed up all night in her bed

The next morning was Christmas
Over at the house
We saw all the family
For dinner we had grouse (aka - roast beef)

We exchanged all our presents
Spoiled the kids and the dogs
Ashley got toys
And the uncles got iPods

So we went home
And found a dead bear
Revived her via Dr Ebay
And regrew her hair

And sorted out presents
And hauled it all upstairs
We will do it again next winter
And do it will great care.
