Great Grandma and Granddad Toothman sent over the doll house that Ashley had fallen in love with during her visits.  We have other boxes of stuff that we can doll out surely but slowly.

It turns out that Ashley is indeed still a bit young to be left alone with the doll house, so we eventually ended up putting the doll house up on a shelf for now.  It won't be long before we can get it down and let Ashley play with it on her own.
