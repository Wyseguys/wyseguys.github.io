MY FEET WERE ON BLOODY FIRE, THEY SCABBED OVER AND WERE STUCK IN ICE SKATE RENTALS THAT WERE CLEARLY FILLED WITH SALT AND EVIL.

But Ashley did a nice job skating with Aunt Becky and Aunt Katie. Â It was pretty fun, I wish I could have been out there a bit more to skate with her, but my stubby pained hubs kept me on the sidelines.
