I"»<p>Mom had the idea. Â Dad had the car, the tape measure and he knew where Lowes was. Â Most importantly, he had a method of payment.</p>

<p>Then we spent a Saturday at Grandpa Duckys (after spending a Friday night there) and Grandpa showed us how to make the plans for the planter window box that Mom wanted. Â We then went to the store with Ducky and got all the materials and Ducky spent an entire afternoon showing Dad how to do it.</p>
