I"g<p>It is a pretty nice house. Well built. Sturdy. The carpet is a deep purple, which isn’t for me, but it feels nice. I would assume if you like dark colors or classic rock you are looking at a winner here.</p>

<p>There is a pool in the backyard. Yes, an above ground jobbie, BUT IT HAS A DEEP END. 6ft. I like it. In fact, I don’t think the house will be for sale this summer because I’d like to keep that pool as global warming pushes the temperature over 1,000,000 degrees.</p>

<p>And it is close to the Black Bird. There is some pretty junky stuff, but MAN, it is the Blackbird. it is huge and rad.</p>
