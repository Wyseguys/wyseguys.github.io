I"ö<p>We went with Auntie Laurel to a dirty farm filled with filthy farm animals.Â  It was a pretty cool time.Â  There were goats, pigs, deer and a wallaby.Â  The wallaby didnâ€™t know what the hell was going on (I think it was drunk) but the other animals were pretty happy to be there.</p>

<p>Ashley rode on the ponies and confirmed the stereotype that little girls like ponies.Â  So if anybody wants to â€œpony upâ€ (zing) and help get the fund started it would be pretty groovy.Â  Mom and Dad donâ€™t want to participate in the horse shenanigans, but we welcome anybody else to buy up a bail of hay.</p>
