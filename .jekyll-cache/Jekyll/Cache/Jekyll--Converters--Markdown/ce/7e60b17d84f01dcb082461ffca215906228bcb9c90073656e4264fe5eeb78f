<ul>
  <li><strong>Fix or build your broken computer?</strong>  I have no idea.</li>
  <li><strong>In home service?</strong>  I have no idea.</li>
  <li><strong>Website Providers?</strong> <a href="http://www.winhost.com/" target="_blank">WinHost.</a>They were the company hosting my website when I thought enough of it to pay.  Now I am using GitHub.io.  A careful examination of this very page will indicate the entirety of how that is done.  I have also use SquareSpace for a customer when it was more important to have a pretty website than it was to do things cheaply. </li>
</ul>

<p>I use Google Apps For Your Domain for my email.  GoDaddy is probably evil, so I use NameCheap for my domains.  Pretty much anybody is probably evil.  I am evil.</p>
<ul>
  <li><strong>Web Design, eCommerce?</strong>  I recommend you don’t do such a silly thing.  I guess the Amazon marketplace.</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="how-do-i-contact-wyse-guys-to-fix-my-pc">How do I contact Wyse Guys to fix my PC?</h3>

<p>We don’t do that anymore. =) What you can do is shoot an email off with a basic question, and I hope that some body would answer it. I can’t make any promises of course, we all have things to do, but we are always glad to help. That is the kind of thinking that we think the world should have.</p>

<h3 id="where-will-the-wyse-guys-do-their-work">Where will the Wyse Guys do their work?</h3>

<p>We don’t do that anymore. ;)</p>

<p>We of course used to work right in your home. On your time, at your ours. Sure we need to respect the fact that you need us, but we also needed you. Don’t settle for some 9 to 5 outfit making you bring in the computer! Your computer has all kinds of important functions in your life, you need somebody who is accountable and will work with your schedule and needs to get things moving again.</p>

<p>At the same time, please respect the person who you hire to fix your computer. They may need time to fix things, they may need tools that are easy to carry, they may just need to go home and watch some T.V. If everybody just is understanding and works together, the computer repair experience can be a smooth and happy one.</p>

<p>I would like to remind you that what you can do is shoot an email off with a basic question, and I hope that some body would answer it. I can’t make any promises of course, we all have things to do, but we are always glad to help. That is the kind of thinking that we think the world should have.</p>

<h3 id="why-shouldnt-i-go-somewhere-else">Why shouldn’t I go somewhere else?</h3>

<p>You should.   Worst still, we can’t recommend anybody else.</p>

<p>If any of our former customers has found a wonderful replacement, someone with a great personality, great skills, and a fair mind, we would love hear about them. Please drop us a line with that person’s contact information.</p>

<h3 id="who-were-the-wyse-guys">Who were the Wyse Guys?</h3>

<p>Besides a electronic musical group?  <a href="/computers/about/">I guess here</a>.</p>

<h3 id="will-you-be-back">Will you be back?</h3>

<p>Maybe. Who really knows, the world is a very uncertain place. Of course everybody who called themself a Wyse Guys loves computers and technology, so it is a pretty sure bet that we will all stay in the field. I suppose if the world suddenly needs saving, then we will have to re-appear on the horizon and look out over our fair cities once again. Right now there is no plan to return, never say never.</p>

<h3 id="will-you-work-for-me-anyways">Will you work for me anyways?</h3>

<p>It just isn’t possible. There isn’t enough time in the day for our current projects and lives, so fitting in even more work isn’t a feasible thing. We are always willing to help as we can, but usually that would limit what we can provide to emails, and there is no assurance of turn around time.</p>

<p>It is the original concept of Doing a Good Turn Daily that tells us in our hearts we would never turn anybody away, so it sure doesn’t hurt to ask</p>

<h3 id="do-you-have-any-wyse-terminals-sale">Do you have any Wyse terminals sale?</h3>

<p>Nope. It is just an unfortunate that our clever marketing name is the brand of a popular industrial terminal. Thank heavans that the Wyse Corporation has not sued. I also understand that there is an ourfit also going under the name Wyse Guys who does fix terminals. Sadly, we are not they. We don’t know how to find those cats. Good luck, and if you are they, tell us, and I will post your site here.</p>

<p>In the mean time, I was contacted by a company who does service wyse parts. This type of proactive stance means that I endores them. Don’t think that my standards are so light for PC repair. If I say someone can fix your computer, it is because I believe they can. If I say someone can service your Wyse parts, it is because they told me they could. Anyways, check the contact page.</p>

<h3 id="can-i-email-you">Can I email you?</h3>

<p>Sure, I don’t promise that anybody will mail you back. Please visit our contact page for the only working address from before.</p>

<h3 id="will-you-update-your-site">Will you update your site?</h3>

<p>With what? Make a suggestion, I would be happy to consider it. Most of the types of information that I would post here would just be a poorly written re-hash of information freely available on the Internet.  Google or Live.com or Yahoo or whatever.  I am not a creator of ideas, so head to the source.</p>

<h3 id="will-you-sell-me-your-domain-name">Will you sell me your domain name?</h3>

<p>Nope. Not unless you are offering some absurd amount of money.  You snooze your lose.</p>
