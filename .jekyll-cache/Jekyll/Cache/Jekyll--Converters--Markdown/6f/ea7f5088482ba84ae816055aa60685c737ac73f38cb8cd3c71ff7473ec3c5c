I"‚<p>Dear Jeff,</p>

<p>I want to thank the food court for itâ€™s wonderful service. Last week as many of you know, I was trapped in my room by a swarm of very angry hornets. If it was not for the brilliant and timely actions of the food court, I surely would have been lost. Thanks to all the brave men and women who saw to it that I had plenty of Ice Cream and Waffle Fries to eat.</p>
