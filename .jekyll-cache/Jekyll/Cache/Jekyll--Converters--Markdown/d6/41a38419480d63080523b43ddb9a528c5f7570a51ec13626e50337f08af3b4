I"%<p>For the week of 6-15-2009 through 6-19-2009 was Ashley’s biggest week ever.  We had the departure of a long time companion and favorite baby sitting Aunt Tylee.  Ashley and Tylee were tight like tigers, and we are sure that Ashley will miss her Aunt lots.  Tylee was great the short time we had with her, and Mary and Chris will miss her as well.  But it is a new beginning for Tylee in California and the whole family wishes her the best and we know she will make the most of the opportunities in front of her.  Say bye bye Aunt Tylee.  Bye bye.</p>

<p>The next big news was Ashley making her debut at child care.  Our new daytime baby sitters are downtown, and while not as close as we would like, she is within a lunch time visit for Chris.  Mary will drop us both off in the morning, Chris will bus it to his office and Mary can continue on to her work.  It takes a little extra time so both Chris and Mary need to get on it sooner in the morning and will be cranky for the foreseeable future, but it is easy enough.</p>

<p>The fact that Ashley loves her new daycare is a big bonus and huge relief.  A daily report is given so we know what she is up to, and everybody already knows Ashley and bids her farewell everyday.  Big people food is on the menu everyday, and still as always Ashley is proving that being a picky eater doesn’t fit into her time table.  The upside is that Ashley will snack and eat whatever meal Mary puts together, but the downside is that we have lots of baby food left over.  Chris will continue to try and work the chicken mush into the menu, but mom will put the kabash on it everytime she finds the offense.  Daddy is too cheap, but it is fair as Ashley is ready for the big people food to keep up with her growing body.</p>

<p>Here is the week breakdown:  <em>(Warning, this is proud daddy stuff, very little of interest in included in this chart.)</em></p>
