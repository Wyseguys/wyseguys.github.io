I"æ<p>Let‚Äôs get this over with.</p>

<p>So as I said, I am a pretty easy going person and I could tolerate this situation pretty endlessly. But as I hinted earlier, Jed eventually made this situation unlivable. Here‚Äôs how it goes down:</p>

<p>I‚Äôve long been using a cellphone since Jed pretty much has control of our apartment phone, and whenever anyone calls he‚Äôll answer with crazytalk. To my knowledge, he still has access to the store room in Longs Drugs, from which he has been stealing crates full of random stuff.</p>

<p>Anyway, lately, Jed was more active than usual. I hear a lot of heavy stuff getting dragged around, and crashing, and lots of moaning, hollering, and other psychotic outbursts.</p>

<p>One evening I hear Jed making a hell of a lot of noise, then silence. Then I hear the front door slam, and his truck goes off. A while later, he comes back, I hear more slamming into things, and a bunch of really high pitched loud vocalizations, kind of like whales mating.</p>

<p>I get a call on my cellphone. This is basically how it goes.</p>

<p><em>*ring*</em></p>

<p><em>*pickup*</em></p>

<ul>
  <li><strong>Jed:</strong> SSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSATAN!</li>
  <li>Me: Hi Jed. You‚Äôre nuts.</li>
  <li><strong>Jed:</strong> I HAVE SARAH (Jed‚Äôs ex girlfriend)</li>
  <li>Me: Really.</li>
  <li><strong>Jed:</strong> LISTEN.</li>
</ul>

<p>I immediately hear a high pitched shrieking from the other end of the apartment, and banging and stumbling around. Sarah is a water polo champ. I think if he somehow got her into the apartment, he would have to hit her in the head with his big geologists hammer, because there‚Äôs no way he would be able to wrestle her inside conscious. At any rate, I bet at the time that he hadn‚Äôt grabbed Sarah, and the high pitched screaming was really that crazy motherfucker. I‚Äôve been getting all kinds of crazy phone calls from Jed lately, so I call bluff:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Me: That sounds like you Jed.</li>
  <li><strong>Jed:</strong> COME AND SEE.</li>
  <li>Me: I need to study. Bye Jed.</li>
</ul>

<p><em>*click*</em></p>

<p>This is a very normal response from me, because by this point Jed has been calling me and saying all kinds of crazy shit. Basically, if I can hear him through the wall, I completely disregard anything he might say on the phone. He‚Äôs called me once and begged for help because he‚Äôs stranded on the nascar race track in the middle of a race and I can clearly hear him through the wall. So I have a very trained automated response to Jed‚Äôs calls: ‚ÄúHi Jed. You‚Äôre crazy. That‚Äôs nice. I need to study. Bye Jed.‚Äù</p>

<p>At this point, I smell smoke. This is very disconcerting, because as I said earlier, I have been living in fear of the whole place going up in flames. I stand up from my desk, and at that very moment, the power goes out, and I hear Jed laughing like crazy through the wall. I hear what sounds like something banging against the pipes in his bathroom, and some other, deeper noises, which I haven‚Äôt heard before. The noises have a sort of deep bass resonance, like a big drum, as if a bull or some other large creature were banging around over there. Jed‚Äôs a small guy, and I didn‚Äôt think him capable of moving shit around heavy enough to make that kind of noise with that degree of frequency. Since I smelled smoke and the power was out, I grab my gigantic wrench, smear some vic‚Äôs on my nose, put on my leather jacket, put on a motorcycle helmet I confiscated from Jed, and prepare myself for battle, maglight in hand.</p>

<p>I am really psyched up at this point. I know a lot of you will be saying that I was stupid for operating like this, but I reasoned with myself that I had better go over there just in case he HAD captured some poor girl and was, I dunno, by the noise of it, bludgeoning her to death with a tuba. I headed around to Jed‚Äôs car and looked inside. I saw he had rope and there was blood inside the cabin. I tried the door, it was locked. I smashed the window with a wrench and went inside the cabin. Behind the seat was some bloody rags. Ohhhh shit. At this point I decide I had better get the fuck in there and stop whatever he was up to. I felt really guilty at this point for letting it get this far. I decided that if I were to go in there and die, I would‚Äôve earned it for letting him get that crazy for that long.</p>

<p>I trucked it over to the door, set my wrench on the ground, and fumbled for my keys. I unlocked the door but it wouldn‚Äôt give. The door was moist. I didn‚Äôt quite understand that. I pushed and pushed but it hardly moved an inch. So I started stomping at the door as hard as I could. Eventually I heard something slide and shift and collapse on the other side of the door, and I gave it another kick. My foot actually made a hole and went through the door, and I fell over. I started freaking out because I was worried Jed would stab my boot or something, so I struggled and hurt my ankle. I also broke my foot from the kicking. Eventually I calmed and got my foot out of the door, and bodychecked the door. It came flying off the hinges, and came completely to pieces.</p>

<p>Ok, so I bashed the door in, and I went flying into the apartment, head first into a wall that is right in front of the doorway. The couch had been barricaded against the door, and my kicking caused it to tip over. It was still partially blocking the door. I immediately started struggling wildly once I was on the floor, flailing my wrench and maglight everywhere in case something was about to jump on me. I immediately exited the apartment, grabbed a metal patio chair, and hurled it into the blackened apartment in case anyone was in there. The motorcycle helmet was making it really hard to hear any kind of ambush, and it was covered in grease and filth from the couch, so I ditched it, and proceeded inside. It was night time out so I didn‚Äôt get the benefit of a good light source from outside, and my maglight had grease on it. I saw a glow coming from the corner. I tried to smell if there was smoke coming from a particular direction, but the Vic‚Äôs vaporub made it difficult. I swung my light around the room and found it full of trash like it was before. There was no way I could ascertain whether Jed was hiding under something. I did note that some of the newspapers were covered in what looked like splotches of blood. From my forensics training I could gather from the splotches that whatever shed them was moving at a high rate of speed through the apartment.</p>

<p>I bounded over the couch into the apartment, landing on my broken foot, and falling on my face, in a lot of pain. I remembered the tarantulas and freaked out again, scrambling to my feet and stumbling over towards the source of light. I discovered that Jed had stolen a large floodlight from Longs drugs, which was in the corner, smouldering the carpet. I grabbed that and quickly shone it all over the place. Suddenly I saw that there was a guy about 6 feet tall wearing a beige suit about two feet away from me, so I flipped the fuck out and tackled it. It turned out to be a cardboard standup of Captain Kirk Jed got somehow. I picked up my wrench again and limped onward.</p>
