I"É<p>Dear Jeff,</p>

<p>Back for another wonderful year. So many changes all over the campus. Life itself is an ever-changing adventure. Please donâ€™t misunderstand me, I welcome change with the youthful exuberance of any spring chicken, but I am so glad to see that the food court is exactly where it used to be. It sure made getting my first meal easy, because I already knew where the delicious food was, especially those heavenly waffle fries were.)</p>
