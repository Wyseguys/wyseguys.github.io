I"é<p>My kid is staring to want to sit on the toilet after going potty at 21 months.Â  Her timing is off but the will is there; once we get the timing right there will be nothing but songs from our bathroom.Â  (Our potty training toilet sings when you use it)</p>

<ul>
  <li>She might not have a lot of hair.</li>
  <li>She might not have a lot of teeth.</li>
  <li>She might not string sentences together.</li>
  <li>But she craps where she is supposed to.&lt;</li>
</ul>

<p>Hell yea.</p>
