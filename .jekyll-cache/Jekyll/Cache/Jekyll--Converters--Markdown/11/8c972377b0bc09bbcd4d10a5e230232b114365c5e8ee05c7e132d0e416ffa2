I"∞<p><strong>I have seen the good and bad side of life:</strong></p>

<ul>
  <li>I am educated, but I have made silly mistakes</li>
  <li>I have saved and lost considerable sums of money</li>
  <li>I have succeeded at work, and I have failed at my job</li>
  <li>I have owned a house, and lost it.</li>
  <li>I have experienced a warm embrace from a friend, I know friends who have been violently attacked</li>
  <li>I have found and lost love, only to find it once again</li>
  <li>I have a child, and my world will never be the same.</li>
</ul>

<p>I am a willful man. Each year older sees me less petulant and more willing to heed advice from my elders. Every birthday I learn more about what truly does and does not matter.</p>

<p>I have seen quite a bit. I have known of war, famine, disaster and sunny days. I have read many books, watched many movies, and listened to many many songs.</p>

<p>I have thought. Long, contemplative hours of thought. I have made strides towards wisdom. Sometimes I fail, other times I succeed.</p>

<p>I see more in every day things and actions and behaviors today than I did yesterday; I will see more still tomorrow.</p>

<p>For all of that, for all of those attempts at growing old as well as growing up. I learned something just now. Something I never knew before.</p>

<p>That bumper sticker that reads ‚ÄúHonk if you are horny‚Äù is a pun.</p>

<p><em>(I wonder when my brain actually stopped working‚Ä¶)</em></p>
