I"(<p>Dear Jeff,</p>

<p>You do a wonderful job. Somebody took the time to clean the dickens out of those floors. My feet didn’t stick in even one spot. That kind of foresightedness should be met with a pay increase. I am on the boat. I know my fellow food court diners are too!</p>

<p>thanx</p>
