I"<p>All the pages are pretty clean. I still need to fight the middle ones to get them to validate, but other than that I am golden. It irks me that I can’t figure out how to get the Google javascript to validate. I probably need to go back through the site and get into XHTML*.</p>

<p>I don’t want to redo the whole site again. You readers need to click some links. C’mon Google agreed to pay me if you look at these ads for water damage repair.</p>

<p>*Just kidding. XHTML is the holy chalice, it doesn’t really exist.</p>
