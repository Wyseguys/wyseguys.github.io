I"ç<p>Without further ado, here is the way to make it.
You will need</p>

<ul>
  <li>1 brown paper bag.</li>
  <li>About 2 1/2 poppers of popped corn</li>
  <li>1 cup brown sugar</li>
  <li>1/2 cup butter (a stick)</li>
  <li>1/4 cup light syrup</li>
  <li>1/2 teaspoon salt</li>
  <li>1/2 teaspoon baking soda</li>
  <li>1 teaspoon vanilla</li>
</ul>

<p>Pop about 6 inches of popped corn in the large brown paper bag. Next combine brown sugar, butter, corn syrup, and salt in a skillet and bring that to a boil. You will need to cook it while boiling for 2 minutes while boiling. After the time is up, add baking soda and vanilla and stir well until you mixture is smooth. Not too much stirring, because you need it rather liquidy. Pour your syrup over popcorn in bag, and stir it up with a spoon, and give the bag a hearty shake.</p>

<p>Now microwave the bag for 1 1/2 minutes and shake it up again. Turn the bag over and microwave for another 1 1/2 minutes and shake for the last time. Pour the corn into a bowl. If you havenâ€™t eaten most of it already, wait until it is dry and store in air tight container.</p>

<p>p.s. The syrups gets hotter than an egg in the desert. So just you watch it.</p>

<p>p.p.s. I wish I had a category for delicious</p>
