I"p<p>Ashley is a better bowler than either of us.  She was charming at the lanes and basically a good sport.  Part of being a good bowler in Ashley’s world is charming the glitter off of the nice ladies in the lane next to us and the nice server lady.  Everybody was impressed.</p>

<p>Ashley scored a legitimate 30 (without weak bumper usage) in her 4 frames.</p>
