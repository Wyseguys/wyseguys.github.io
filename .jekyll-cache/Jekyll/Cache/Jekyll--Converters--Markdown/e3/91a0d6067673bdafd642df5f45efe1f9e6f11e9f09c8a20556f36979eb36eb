I"°<p>We went camping the day after memorial day. Â It was pretty awesome, as all the drunks left without burning up all their firewood. Â Mary agreed to leave the fish alone and just murder worms, while Ashley and I wentÂ spelunking. Â (We dropped stones in the water and they went <em>spelunk</em>)</p>
