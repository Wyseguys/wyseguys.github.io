I"ˆ<p>Dear Jeff,</p>

<p>Recently I discovered one-ply toilet paper in my dorm latrine. This is a great idea except certain greedy students will now use twice as much paper instead of caution to avoid paper tears. I suggest you make an investment in some sort of t.p. dispenser which limits the number of squares used. Now if you do that, youâ€™ll see some $aving$ in toilet paper expenses.</p>
