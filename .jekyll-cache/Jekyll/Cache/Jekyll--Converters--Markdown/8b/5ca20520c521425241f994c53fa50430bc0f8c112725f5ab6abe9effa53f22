I"Ž<p>Dear Jeff,</p>

<p>Last time you served the potato bar, a funny thing happened. The strange combination of potato, sour cream, cheese, and olives made a near perfect replica of Elton Johnâ€™s face. (Colors didnâ€™t match, but what do you expect, it was a potato) I was astounded. I had no idea that potato was a viable art medium. Does this mean that you will raise the price on potato bar?</p>
