<p>I agree, what I did was absolutely the worst response to the situation. If you think about it, this poor guy had a serious problem, and I was the only one who could help him, and I chose not to. I am in no way a hero in this situation. It is only the most capricious, fateful of windfalls that neither of us are dead, and I ended up enriched in the end.</p>

  <p><em>Yeah, that‚Äôs my point exactly, but I still don‚Äôt understand why you didn‚Äôt solve it the simple way earlier on by contacting the proper authorities. Why didn‚Äôt you?</em></p>

<p>I go over this rationale earlier in the thread. Really, it was so long ago I find it hard to remember just why I did what I did, the way I did it. Partly I left things as they were because I was mad, and I wanted to prove that he would really fuck things up if I wasn‚Äôt there to clean his shit up. Partly, I didn‚Äôt really care what he did, because if he fucked stuff up it was his ass on the line. Partly, I was sort of curious, in that manner of a distant bystander, just how awful things would get before the forces around us intervened. Finally, I wanted to see how long I could get by witholding rent in a righteous indignation. Really, I let it go on for the most petty, inexcusable reasons imaginable.</p>

  <p><em>As someone who does a bit of work in burned and damaged homes, I would not enter a house like the one you have described without a protective suit and a half-mask.

<p>I used to clean apartments, and, believe it or not, with the exception of the bathroom and the tub, I‚Äôve seen worse.</p>

<p>Oh haha, I forgot one silly little detail.</p>

<p>The cops were about to go into the apartment, and I told them, ‚ÄúBe careful. He has tons of tarantulas and they‚Äôre probably all over the place in there.‚Äù</p>

<p>After that they gave eachother a look and decided to wait for the moonsuit crew.</p>

<p>Close, but no cigar. Let me see if I can mspaint it with my shitty skills.</p>

<p>This is somewhat close but the proportions are all off. The green area is the common area/kitchen and part of the kitchen is the closet. I am really shitty with graphical representation. The blue area is the fortress of good and the bathroom of the fortress of good, and the red area is his room and his bathroom of foulness and evil. To the far left you can see the sliding door as a black blotch, and the front door is to the bottom. At the far right you can see a little grey blotch I drew to represent a fountain he got caught pissing in one day before all this shit went down.</p>

<p>The picture is painfully badly done, but it is basically correct.</p>

<p>You missed the part where I took off the helmet because it prevented me from hearing an ambush and was covered in greasy shit that was growing on the couch.</p>

<p>That couch is a whole other story too. We had two couches, one was a common couch and one was this crazy couch my roomie had bought at a garage sale. The crazy couch was made of black fur, and was gigantic. It was the one blocking the door, and had shit growing all over it. I don‚Äôt know how, but somehow mold is all greasy when it gets wiped on stuff. I‚Äôm not sure where the other couch was at the second re-entry. I can‚Äôt remember if it was blocking the hallway or what.</p>

<p>This all went down 3-4 years ago, which is why I‚Äôm a little hazy on details, and dashing in and adding additional details.</p>

<p>Sure. Also, please use the names I used, because they are fake, and I don‚Äôt want Jed‚Äôs family suing me or something for slander.</p>

<p>Also give me a bigger wrench than Shii did. That wrench I brought along was almost 2 feet long.</p>

  <p><em>How exactly did you meet this guy again?</em></p>
</blockquote>

<p>I can‚Äôt remember for sure, but I think a friend from some general ed psychology class from my first year of college lived with him, and gave me his name when I was looking for a new place to stay. Jed‚Äôs family rented him this cottage unit and he basically sublet a portion of it to a number of people over time. I was his last tenant.</p>

  <p><strong>Kaiser Bill came out of the closet to say:</strong></p>

  <p><em>Also, being ‚Äúuptight with yourself‚Äù but ‚Äúlaid back for other people‚Äù sounds to me like you let yourself be a doormat. Don‚Äôt do that.</em></p>
</blockquote>

<p>It‚Äôs hard to convey the strong, stoic attitude without sounding like either an asshole or a doormat, but, to try again to put it simply: A doormat tries to overextend his control and folds at the drop of a hat. An asshole rigidly defines his influence, extending it over other people, and doesn‚Äôt fold even when it‚Äôs futile to resist. I choose my battles very carefully, and where I do assert myself, there is no amount of insanity that will cause me to budge. For all the awfullness, Jed didn‚Äôt really intrude upon me. I had a few months of very nice, intrusion free existence, where I had all that I wanted in a little exclusive area of the house for very little rent. Where Jed tried to fuck with my shit, I set things up so he couldn‚Äôt. Where I couldn‚Äôt do that, I just removed myself from the equation. Choose your battles. I wouldn‚Äôt stick around in the common area and bitch and whine like a pussy, or pick fights like an ass. I would just remove myself from the conflict, and continue to live the good life. In the fortress of awesomeness.</p>

</blockquote>

<p>You‚Äôve got me. I figured he would at least be caught stealing stuff from longs drugs or various construction sites, but somehow he managed. He looked very white and upstanding, so I don‚Äôt think he got much trouble.</p>

<p>It actually took quite a bit of time because I was spending a lot of time investigating every nook and cranny for a psychotic with a knife. You‚Äôd be suprised at how much time a slow walkthrough of an apartment cottage that size can take. I think entry to exit on the first Dark Time trip took me about 25 minutes. The second one took about 15 minutes, not counting the door bashing.</p>
