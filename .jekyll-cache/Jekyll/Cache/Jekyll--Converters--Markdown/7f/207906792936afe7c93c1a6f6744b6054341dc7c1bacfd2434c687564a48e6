I"»<p>Here is an example of when I got up on someone, instead of the normal pattern of me having to eat crow.</p>

<!--more-->
<p>When I was running the Southern Oregon University computer lab (I was adjunct prof teaching hardware) the helpdesk people came in to do a training on their Novell Groupwise email client.</p>

<p>The guy doing the training, Mike (an old navy guy, a pal) was yapping on and on about how to check and send mail. Then he started in on how good the spam protection was. (2001ish?) â€œYou really aernâ€™t going to see any spam in our system, every email you get is probably real. Some spam gets throughâ€¦ but not muchâ€¦.â€,</p>

<p>Now Mike is doing this by projecting on the wall HIS email account. He is logged in and showing HIS email to the group of incoming work study students.</p>

<p>So of course I change my email clients name and â€œfromâ€ address to something nasty like â€œSexy Friends4Uâ€ or whatever and send him an email subject â€œMike T, you recent subscription to hot horny girls needs to be updatedâ€</p>

<p>Which of course does the thing where it flashes in the lower right of the window when he gets a new email, and therefore he and all the students saw it appear on the projector</p>

<p>He had to back peddle and then go into some stuff about fake emails and address book hacking as to why his name was on it.</p>

<p>I never did tell himâ€¦ he probably figured it out on his own later. It never came up again.</p>
