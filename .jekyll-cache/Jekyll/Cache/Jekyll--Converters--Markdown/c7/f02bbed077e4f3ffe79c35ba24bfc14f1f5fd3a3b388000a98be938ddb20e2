I"¬<p>Ashley and the gang traveled to Athena this year for Christmas.Â  We left Thursday the 24th packed to the gills with presents and a happy baby.Â  We arrived to a house full of people in Athena and had a rocking couple of dinners, breakfasts and more snacks than a pelican could fit in itâ€™s beak.Â  Ashley learned some new life skills with cooking in the kitchen with Grandma and reloading shells with Grandpa.Â  The uncles showed Ashley how to ride a skateboard and Aunt Tylee taught Ashley the fine art of light saber fighting.</p>

<p>We caught a burger and even a rare Ellis sighting on the way out of town.Â  It was a pretty reasonable trip home and Ashley was basically good the whole time, but did not nap.Â  Even though mom went on a bit of a tear putting away clothes and boxing up old toys, it was a pretty good Christmas for everybody.</p>
