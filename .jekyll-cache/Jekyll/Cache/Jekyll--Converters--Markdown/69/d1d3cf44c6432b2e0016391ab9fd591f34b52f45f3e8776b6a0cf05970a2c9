I".<p>This is a recipe for lemon ice my grandma made when I was a kid. She wrote it down one day when I first left home after college and I really liked it.</p>

<p>This was something I couldn’t find online.  There are lots of recipes online for something called “lemon ice” but they often aren’t exactly this.  I sort of think this is some family thing, depression era food.  Tastes good, easy to make, pretty cheap.</p>

<p>I’d often get this with my family when we’d have dinner over at Grandma and Grandpa’s house.  There is a kind of a weird “lemon and milk” texture on my mouth, but all the sugar more than made up for it.</p>

<p>Like most things in my life, I don’t have any confusion that this is fine dining or hoi paloi, but I honestly prefer it that way.</p>
