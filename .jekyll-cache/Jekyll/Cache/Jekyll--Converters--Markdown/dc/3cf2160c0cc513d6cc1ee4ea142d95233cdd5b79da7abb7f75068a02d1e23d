I":<p>It was finally a nice day in Portland.  Not only a nice day, but a day when we were both home, had no work, no shopping, no chores and time to burn.  Mary and I took Ashley to the park to get into the swings.  Ashley really likes to swing.</p>

<p>So Ashley and her folks went to the park at the end of our block to enjoy the first sunny day of April in 2009.  The swings were a favorite but walking herself home was the real treat of the afternoon.</p>

<p>The real news is that Ashley is now a marathon walker.  There are reports of her walking over a half mile from the pharamacy down the street to our front door.  Props goes out to Aunt Tylee for doing the Ashley Trail of Tears without picking Ashley up and dragging her home by her legs.</p>
