I"G<p>Dear Jeff,</p>

<p>I love the waffle fries. I don’t want to be a whiner, but I found a broken tooth in my salad Monday. I know that 150 people have about 4800 teeth, but I worked at the Popcorn Hut, and we were required to wear teeth nets. Is this not a requirement in Oregon? I don’t mind, but other patrons might.</p>
