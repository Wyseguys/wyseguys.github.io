I" <p>As I have learned from my father, (who is a great father) I try to be super involved with my kid. I have done my best to emulate what my dad did for me.  Always being around, doing things I don’t want to do because my kid does want to do it.  I am, (I guess we are), statistically speaking, in the lower end of testicle size.</p>
