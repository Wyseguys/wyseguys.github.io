This site serves two purposes:

First, so I can learn and practice what I think is the most helpful for my day job.  I want to learn, maybe not the bleeding edge, but definitely keeping modern.

Second, this is where the shitty roommate story lives for some links on the Internet.  I monetize links to that story (I've made nearly $100 in the 8 years I've had it online)

Therefore, I probably won't be taking any pull requests.  That said, I mean, go ahead.  I'll *probably* ignore you, or I will write back and say thanks but no thanks.  However if you still really have to get it off your chest, go ahead.
